# Macro WP-Site
This repo is initially scafolded from [faust-scaffold-ts](https://github.com/wpengine/faust-scaffold-ts)

I am using railway for local development since setting up wordpress locally is both a pain and is somewhat fragile.


1. [install railway cli](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli#installation)
1. `railway link dd2bf6c4-d41e-449a-850b-29a065ae5b3a`
1. `railway run pnpm dev`

This will load the wordpress env vars from railway and run the dev server locally
